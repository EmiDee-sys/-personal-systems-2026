- contacted Kevin for any webmasters update (ie. need to throttle your email so you have more space, something on the website not working)
- finish newsletter 
- all workshops free or make or take has a QR code that will go to the website.  we want to encourage everyone to sign up regardless if it's free or not so we have a running list.  This QR code works for every workshop we put on even if it's last minute because the attendee has to type in the information and fill out the form to let us know what they are signing up for.  If the workshop is a make and take, we will notify the workshop host to the sign up if they have not registered yet through the workshop host when they take care payment.  In the future we hope to put everything into the system through square and also receive a commission for this processing of workshops unless it is taught in house.
